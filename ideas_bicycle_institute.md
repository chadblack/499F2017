RE:  IDEAS FOR THE BICYCLE INSTITUTE

Here are some ideas that I jotted down quickly in connection with your
intended presentation to the Bicycle Institute. There are several areas in
which research and public relations could be done in connection with
bicycles.

1. **What does the bicycle really mean to the American youngster?** It would
   seem to me that hte American boy is not completely sure of himself in
   wanting a bicycle. It is not an accepted national toy or vehicle for
   transportation as it is in other countries. He is bound to feel,
   therefore, somewhat on the extravagant side, particularly if he has
   reached a certain age when it is considered foolish, or childish to want
   a bicycle. A European youngster considers the demand for a bicycle an
   almost utilitarian request and therefore can be much more insistent, will
   be more more inclined to insist on a good bicycle. In connection with
   this, there is the fact that the youngster does not actually have too
   many opportunities to use his bicycle ecause of the lack of encouragement
   by his parents and by the community in which he lives. He may feel guilty
   if he insists upon a bicycle and then discovers that he hasn't used it
   too often in the course of the year. After a few years, his interest in
   it wears off and it is sold again.

2. **Possibilities of Expanding Bicycle Use**
   Research would also have to be done to ascertain how best to create
   greater awareness of the real possibilities of the bicycle. As is well
   know, (sic) the bicycle has a much more glamorous position in other
   nations, particularly in Holland and France, that it has in this country.
   The bicycle assumes a role here that skis used to have. A tremendous job
   has been done as far as skiing is concerned. Today it has become a
   national sport, while only twenty or twenty-five years ago, very few
   people were interested in skiing and they were considered on the nutty
   side for being interested. In a research study, we may want to find, in
   connection with this second point, what it is that prevents the bicycle
   from becoming and being a national institution in this country. What made
   it a national institution in other countries?

3. **It might be possible to reverse the safety factor.** 
   Many parents may be afraid to let their children ride to school on a
   bicycle, yet when told that this is an excellent means of educating them
   to obey traffic rules and to become familiar through actual experience
   with the whole concept of driving and mangement of traffic, they may well
   be influenced in favor of the bicycle.

4. **The Bicycle as a Means of Self-Sufficiency**
   The bicycle might be considered an excellent means for developing
   self-sufficiency. It gives the youngster a feeling of independence. It
   permits him to explore the neighborhood, gives him the kind of extensions
   of his power that the car gives to the adult.

5. **Familiarity with Mechanics**
   The bicycle very frequently is, or can be made ot be, the first lesson in
   the whole field of mechanics. When trained properly, a youngster will
   soon learn how to oil his bike properly, how to tieghten the cahins and
   how to do minor repair work. Thus he will have received an excellent
   initial training which permits him to adjust himself better to this
   mechanical world.

6. **Bicycles in the News**
   Research jobs could also be done to determine how bicycles could be
   treated in a more prominent fashion in movies, in novels and in news
   stories. In line with all this, there could be some investigation on what
   could be done to introduce bicycles into the sports world.

7. **Bicycles and the Schools**
   Schools represent an excellent means of introducing bicycles and
   glamorizing them. Particularly in rural areas, teachers might be
   interested to use bicycles to come to school on, instead of driving cars.
   Special parking places for bikes could be provided in the School parking
   area, and in community shopping areas.

If even as little were done as to influence architects to provide space for
bicycles in homes, to give the youngster a place in the garage where he knows
his bicycle has a permanent place, all these factors might prove to be of
great value.
