Department guidelines for 499 set the following expectations for students:

1. to research and write a paper that displays the skills they have learned
   throughout the major;

2. to learn to develop a research question;

3. to learn to build an argument using primary sources and relevant secondary literature;

4. to do history on another level, not merely as consumers but as writers of history;

5. to progress to a stage where they can conduct research and teach themselves things they donâ€™t know;

6. to learn to take a large volume of information and explain it in an
   intelligible format.

These skills will culminate in the student writing a 4,500-6,000 word research
paper in which they advance their own historical argument. We will work on
these goals on paper and in discussion.

Reading, writing, and oral assignments for this course are designed to meet
these goals. In meeting them, you will also be able to place the bicycle in its
historical contexts and ambiguities-- as sport, technology, leisure, work,
transport, etc.
