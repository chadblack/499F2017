Reminder: pdfs are available in the Dropbox folder I provided over email.

We will divide each class meeting into three parts-- lecture, discussion, and
laboratory. Quotes in the schedule were drawn from Michael Carabetta, *Words to
Ride By: Thoughts on Bicycling* (San Francisco: Chronicle Press, 2017).

> The very existence of the bicycle is an offense to reason and wisdom.

 you think the bicycles in the film symbolize.

**Week Seven** -- The Bicycle and Space (October 4)

> Most bicycles in NYC obey instinct far more than they obey the traffic laws,
which is to say that they run red lights, go the wrong way on one-way streets,
violate cross-walks, and terrify innocents, because it just seems easier that
way. Cycling in the city, and particularly in midtown, is anarchy without
malice.

> by one a wheel... the picture of free, untrammeled womanhood.
>

> insisted on taking mine indoors and the first night I even kept it in my bed.
>
> John Lennon
