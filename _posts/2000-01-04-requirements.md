#### assignments

The assignments in this course are aimed at helping, step by step, the student 
to successfully accomplish a semester-long research project. We will be reading 
widely, across topics that intersect with the bicycle. We will also be writing
regularly, sharing our writing with each other, and spending a lot of time in
discussion.

1. Memo writing. As part of developing your research skills, each student is
required to write a memo using [this form]() for assigned readings. Memo writing
hones your ability to summarize and synthesize. Some readings will deserve
longer memos than others. This technique will be important for your literature
review, and your paper as well.


2. Short literature review (3-4pp). Students will write a short paper that
analyzes two or three scholarly works (monographs or peer-reviewed articles)
from appropriate academic resources. This paper should demonstrate a working
knowledge of the major debates in the larger field you will be writing on
(sport, technology, gender, race, urban histories, etc.). What are the main
questions that scholars are asking about your topic? How are they answering
those questions? What are their arguments and how do they interact with those
offered by other historians? If you write good memos on what you have read, this
will be a very straightforward assignment.

3. Short primary source analysis (2-3pp). Students will write a short paper that
establishes the context and significance of one or two primary sources that are
important to your final project. This primary source analysis should be
suggestive of the future direction of your paper. Why is the source important to
understanding a core issue in the past? 

4. Annotated bibliography. Students will construct a bibliography of the
secondary and primary sources for their project.

5. One sentence, one paragraph, one page. In this exercise, students will
explain their projects in those chunk-sized bits of text.

6. Final paper. The paper to end all papers. Students will write a research
   paper of 4,500-6,000 words in length. The paper will have a bibliography.
   The topic will be of the student's choosing, and will use the bicycle as a
   foil to
